# Author: Chase Perry
# Section: A
# Date: 5/2/2017
# Purpose: To find the distance between two planes given their distance
#    and angle to the operator's postition.
# Preconditions: (input)
#   User supplies the distances to either planes and the angle between
#   the planes (as numbers)
# Postconditions: (output)
#   User is asked for distance
#   User is asked for angle theta to the two planes
#   Distance between the two planes is dsiplayed.
#### Main function
# 1. Display introductory message
# 2. Ask the user for d1 and d2 (distance between plane 1  and plane 2 and operator)
# 3. Ask the user for angle theta (angle between the planes)
# 4. Convert angle theta from degrees to radians
# 5. Compute the value of cosine(theta)
# 6. Use the cosine law to compute the desired answer squared
# 7. Square root the result
# 8. Output to the shell the variable
