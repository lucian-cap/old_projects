# Chapter 8: Arrays
This chapter introduces arrays, including one-dimensional arrays, multi-dimensional array, and variable-length arrays for C99.

### Skipped Projects
* 4. This project was just a modification of a program the book author wrote, but that modification was purely how an array was initialized.
* 10. This project asked us to modify the Project 8 from Chapter 5 by using arrays, but I still feel like the knowledge gained wouldn't be worth the effort.
* 13. Modification of Project 11 from Chapter 7, just storing the user input in an array rather than how the original did it.
