# Chapter 27: Additional C99 Support For Mathematics
This chapter provides information on C99 headers that can be used for especially specific arithmetic including the stdint.h, inttypes.h, complex.h, tgmath.h, and fenv.h headers.

### Skipped Projects
* 3.Just the opposite of project 2., math is just going the opposite direction.
* 4.Do NOT understand the math of what the books author is asking for, would need to do some digging to figure out the goal and a starting point just to understand the math side much less the programming side. If needed, could probably do but given it's likely just specific function calls I think I'll survive without it.
