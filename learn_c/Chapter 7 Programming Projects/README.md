# Chapter 7: Basic Types
This chapter provides a little more in depth knowledge about the different data types for integers, floats, and characters. It also discusses conversion between datatypes and how much each type can hold.

### Skipped Projects
* 6. Skipped this project as it was just printing the return of the sizeof() function passing in different variable types.
* 8. This project was a modification of Project 8 from Chapter 5, but loosens the contraints on what the input could look like (but not enough to be much different).
