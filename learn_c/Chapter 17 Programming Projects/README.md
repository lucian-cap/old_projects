# Chapter 17: Advanced Use of Pointers
This chapter discusses how to dynamically allocate memory, creating your own linked lists type structures, and points to other pointers and functions.

### Skipped Projects
* 2. Automatically completed with project 1 of this chapter, just did both as the same time.
* 6. Skipped as it just wanted me to change how the array was sorted, not really worth since I had used qsort for projects 1/2.
* 7. This project wanted me to make a small change from a program the books author wrote for section 17.2, not really worth it since it would be mostly copying code.
