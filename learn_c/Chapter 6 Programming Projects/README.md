# Chapter 6: Loops
This chapter introduces the 'while', 'do', and 'for' statements that allow for repition in a program as well as how to avoid the control of the loops i.e. 'break', 'continue', and 'goto'.

### Skipped Projects
* 3.Skipped as it was just reducing a fractions, which is done by finding the greatest common divisor, which I did in Project 2. 
* 10.Skipped as was a repeat of Project 9 in Chapter 5, but adding in a simple loop. Didn't seem to be worthwhile to make such a small change.
