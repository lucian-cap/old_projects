# Chapter 22: Input/Output
This chapter provides information on streams, file operations, formatting input/output for characters, lines, blocks, and strings, as well as file positioning.

### Skipped Projects
* 9. Skipped this project by accident, might need to go back to it at some point as it could be useful to demonstrate working with multiple files and dealing with potential conflicts.
* 10. Skipped this one b/c it was just a slightly, but not by much, complex version of project 8.
* 13. Again. The flight project from chapter 5.
* 14. - 15. Same projects as some done previously, just use file redirection or reading file names to begin with.
* 17. Simple formatting of simple input.
* 18. This project would've basically just been reading a lot of number and then checking some if statements for each one, not really worth the time.
* 19. Not sure where to begin with this project, don't know if it would be useful or not but if so I'll come back to it later.
