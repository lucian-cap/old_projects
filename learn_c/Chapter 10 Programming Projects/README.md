### Skipped Projects
* 2.-5.Were all making small modifications to a program written by the books author, not something I'm really interested in doing given most of the program would've been written by someone else and the changes weren't that complex. 
* 7.Couldn't quite understand what the book author intended to happen for this project, decided to just skip it cause it's formatting printing.
