# Solutions and Purpose
This repository contains my solutions to K.N. King's "C Programming: A Modern Approach (Second Edition)" programming problems, chapter by chapter. This textbook was used as I had purchased it for a C programming course in college, though the course never went through the entire book. Each folder contains a readme.md file describing what the chapter was about, and each project contains a folder describing the purpose or goal of that specific project. 

My goal with this book was to "fully" learn the C language, gain more experience with the language as a whole, and to give me something to practice on as far as tackling programming issues. For the most part, I would say what I've learned about the language is more self taught than anything else.

## General Information
* Certain projects were skipped due to either their repetitive nature in relation to projects already completed, or because I felt that there wouldn't be much knowledge/experience gained by completing them.
* These projects were completed with GCC version 8.2.0
* The class I purchased this book for only covered up to Chapter 12: Pointers and Arrays, however I didn't keep much of the code I wrote for that class. 
* A number of the early projects were designed around modifying code provide by the author of the book, and I will indicates which projects were like this in the chapters readme.md file. 

## Skipped Chapters
I read each chapter in the book, however these chapters may not be seen here. Following you'll find the reasons for this.
* Chapter 1 contained no programming projects
* Chapter 14: The Preprocessor contained no programming projects
* Chapter 18: Declarations contained no programming projects
* Chapter 20: Low-Level Programming had a single project which I did not feel would benefit me to complete. The entire chapter is probably negligible unless I end up working on something very low level and at that point I would liely reread this chapter and more to prepare.
* Chapter 24: Error Handling contained no programming projects
* Chapter 25: International Features had two projects which were basically just printing information out about default values that dealt with how information is printed to the user.
