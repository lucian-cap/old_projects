# Old Projects

This repo contains some old code I wrote during my undergraduate program, along with some "projects" I did while reading a C programming book. 
Originally I thought these would provide at least some sort of sample of what I know, but looking at it these years later I better understand 
how poor of an example these serve & that they don't illustrate my current work with machine learning (not to mention whatever I wrote during my undergraduate is not my best work). 

This repo needs to be cleaned up, if kept at all. I might go back through the C stuff at some point because I would like to become proficient with 
that and C++ at some point, but the old class stuff I'll go through before clearing out.
